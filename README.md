Welcome to my Business Analytics Projects! Through these projects, I aim to demonstrate my expertise in problem discovery, big data retrieval, data analysis, and creating interesting visualizations.

### Project 1. Where do tech companies prefer to locate (A nuanced district-level analysis)?

I identify preferred locations of tech companies to understand clustering benefits using the Companies House API, inform emerging firms, and assist local governments in fostering collaborative hubs. For visualization, I choose an interactive geographical heatmap, allowing users to explore company distribution at more nuanced level.


### Project 2. Which country do the top executives in game industry primarily come from?

I explore the nationality diversity among top executives in the computer game industry to gauge cultural influences and diversity within industry leadership. For visualization, I choose a treemap to show the nationality concentration.





  Through these two projects, I have become familiar with data analysis using APIs. Thanks to my professor, Pawel! And thank you for exploring my portfolio!ðŸ¥‚
